                <p>The six pillars behind my work are
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><span class="nature">Nature</span> (and life)</li>
                    <li><span class="math">Math</span> (and computation & science)</li>
                    <li><span class="music">Music</span> (and art)</li>
                    <li><span class="community">Community</span> (and teamwork)</li>
                    <li><span class="creativity">Creativity</span> (and cultural evolution)</li>
                    <li><span class="education">Education</span> (and communication)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    It is hard to isolate these pillars and, like <span class="community">community</span> and <span class="education">education</span>, they often overlap. Each pillar, alone, is meaningful to me. But so are their combinations and resulting synergies. This results in six connected pillars.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="nature">Nature</span></a> is an infinite source of inspiration. There is always more detail to admire. <span class="math">Math</span>—the "<em>science of patterns</em>"— is a powerful tool to dig deeper and see beyond the senses. <span class="math">Algorithms</span> and other <span class="math">computational methods</span> can bring <span class="math">math</span> to life. If <span class="math">math</span> is the "<em>science of patterns</em>," then <span class="math">algorithms</span> are the "<em>science of process.</em>"
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is one thing to understand and navigate the world alone. To do it with others requires a <span class="community">shared</span> language with <span class="community">shared</span> meaning—it requires <span class="community">culture</span>, which requires <span class="community">getting on the same page</span>. I think life is better shared—sharing laughs, recipes, skills. <span class="community">Teamwork</span> is a kind of magic that lets the constituents create more together than they could alone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="community">Culture</span> evolves through <span class="education">education</span> and <span class="creativity">creativity</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is easy for me to find the spark and beauty in ideas, and I enthusiastically share them with others.     
                    
                    This is the force that motivates me to do the things I do, from getting a PhD, to teaching, to traveling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From going on a road trip or a hiking trip, to getting a PhD, to teaching and mentoring, these pillars are behind everything I do.

                <p>My work is largely driven by culture, how it holds us together, and how we shape its evolution.</p>

                <p>One of the largest cultural practices that shape the evolution of culture is <em><strong>education</strong></em>.</p>

                <p>Humans are hardwired to learn. We are born to learn culture. We are born to learn language. We are simply born to learn.</p>
