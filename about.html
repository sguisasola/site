                <p>
                    <span id="nature">Nature</span> is an infinite source of inspiration. There is always more detail to admire. <span id="math">Math</span>—the "<em>science of patterns</em>"— is a powerful tool to dig deeper and see beyond the senses. <span id="math">Algorithms</span> and other <span id="math">computational methods</span> can bring <span id="math">math</span> to life. If <span id="math">math</span> is the "<em>science of patterns</em>," then <span id="math">algorithms</span> are the "<em>science of process.</em>"

                <p>
                    It is one thing to understand and navigate the world alone. To do it with others requires a <span id="community">shared</span> language with <span id="community">shared</span> meaning—it requires <span id="community">culture</span>, which requires <span id="community">getting on the same page</span>. I think life is better shared—sharing laughs, recipes, skills. <span id="community">Teamwork</span> is a kind of magic that lets the constituents create more together than they would have alone.

                <p>
                    <span id="community">Culture</span> evolves through <span id="education">education</span> and <span id="creativity">creativity</span>.

                <p>
                    It is easy for me to find the spark and beauty in ideas, and I enthusiastically share them with others.     
                    
                    This is the force that motivates me to do the things I do, from getting a PhD, to teaching, to traveling.

                <p>
                    From going on a road trip or a hiking trip, to getting a PhD, to teaching and mentoring, these pillars are behind everything I do.

                <p>My work is largely driven by culture, how it holds us together, and how we shape its evolution.</p>

                <p>One of the largest cultural practices that shape the evolution of culture is <em><strong>education</strong></em>.</p>

                <p>Humans are hardwired to learn. We are born to learn culture. We are born to learn language. We are simply born to learn.</p>
